Small project for Cryptanalysis course

To compile using gcc and run the labworks, use

```console
cryptanalysis.sh X
```

where X is the number of the corresponding labwork, or the keyword "final" fro the final HW


# Third homework

generate random permutation with `/labwork3/python/gen_random_permutation.py` via

```
python3 ./labwork3/python/gen_random_permutation.py
```

and it stores a random permutation of GF(2^12) in `/labwork3/data/random_permutation.txt` along
with its inverse in `/labwork3/data/random_inverse_permutation.txt`

## NOTE
regenerating the permutation means the message-ciphertext pairs are incompatible with the permutation,
we have to regenerate message-ciphertext pairs as well

To generate random message-ciphertext pairs, first compile the encryption functions to a shared .so object

```
make encryption
```

this compiles to a shared object `/bin/encryption.so`

# TODO: accept t as parametr for python script

and run the python script for random pairs generation

```
python3 ./labwork3/python/gen_message_ciphertext_pairs.py
```

it stores the pairs in `/labwork3/data/message_ciphertext.csv`

# Final homework

run tests: compile to shared object using

```bash

make dl

```

which creates a dl.so shared object file in bin. This is used to run python tests. Run them via

```bash

python3 labwork_final/python/tests.py

```
