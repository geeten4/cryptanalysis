Small project for Cryptanalysis course

To compile using gcc and run the labworks, use

```console
cryptanalysis.sh X
```

where X is the number of the corresponding labwork


# Third homework

generate random permutation with `/labwork3/python/gen_random_permutation.py` via

```
python3 ./labwork3/python/gen_random_permutation.py
```

and it stores a random permutation of GF(2^12) in `/labwork3/data/random_permutation.txt` along
with its inverse in `/labwork3/data/random_inverse_permutation.txt`

To generate random message-ciphertext pairs, first compile the encryption functions to a shared .so object

```
make encryption.so
```

this compiles to a shared object `/bin/encryption.so`

# TODO: accept t as parametr for python script

and run the python script for random pairs generation

```
python3 ./labwork3/python/gen_message_ciphertext_pairs.py
```

it stores the pairs in `/labwork3/data/message_ciphertext.csv`
